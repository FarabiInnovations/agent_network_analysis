Farabi Experiments 

The framework serves as a working baseline for multi-agent risk analysis, providing scaffolding for exploratory analyses. With further refinement, it can evolve into a hardened risk assessment tool. 

Some strengths:

--Cross-Domain Risk Transferability --
Foundational financial network principles adapted to AI contexts through eigenvector and betweenness centrality interpretations.

--Actionable Risk Prioritization --
Combined topological-economic scoring enables targeted hardening of critical nodes 

--Monte Carlo Foundation--
Three-stage simulation architecture (independent → dependent → stable) provides expandable structure.

Some limitations and a few next steps:

Temporal Dynamics: Add rolling adjacency matrices with reinforcement learning (RL) for more of an adaptive risk mitigation.

Security Integration: Security policy. Map the AI-specific attack vectors to centrality metrics. 

Validation: Run some of the benchmarking against hybrid network topologies with some adversarial node injections -
